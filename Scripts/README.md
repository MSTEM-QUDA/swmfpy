Python Scripts
==============

Collection of Python scripts to make using [SWMF](https://gitlab.umich.edu/swmf_software/SWMF) easier. Note most of these require a recent version of Python __3__. Supercomputers typically have this already.

prepare_geospace.py
-------------------

This script is to help with the inputs of the geospace model.

### Pre-steps

If you already have a run directory and `PARAM.in` file then skip ahead.

In the base directory of SWMF run:

```bash
SWMF$ ./Config.pl -install
# Compile then make the run directory if worked
SWMF$ make -j test_swpc_compile && make rundir
```
Make sure [swmfpy](https://gitlab.umich.edu/swmf_software/swmfpy) is installed:

```bash
# In the SWMF base dir
SWMF$ pip install -U --user share/Python/swmfpy
```
*Note*: You may need to change `pip` with `pip3` or `python3 -m pip` depending on your supercomputer's set up.

### Set up


Copy the script into your run directory:

```bash
SWMF$ cp share/Python/Scripts/prepare_geospace.py run/
```

Go to your run directory and copy a sensible `PARAM.in`:

```bash
SWMF$ cd run
SWMF/run$ cp Param/SWPC/PARAM.in_SWPC_v2_init PARAM.in
```

Edit the PARAM.in file to change the `#STARTTIME` and `#ENDTIME` to your liking.

### Running

Then the final steps copy the script and the run directory into a work directory that your supercomputer allows before jobs:

```bash
SWMF$ cp run /some/work/dir/
SWMF$ cd /some/work/dir/
/some/work/dir$ ./prepare_geospace.py
# Then submit job
```
